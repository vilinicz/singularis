While clear differences in test crystallographic structure are observed in our EBSD maps of frosty M. crater (also visible in cross-sectional SEM (Fig 2l)), our data for well-preserved M. crater do not suggest the presence of different crystal structures within this wall type. Such a difference if present could explain the significant difference in crystal size from the innermost side to the outer edge of the test in our altered M. crater specimen, however we attribute this feature to be most likely due to differential effects of post-depositional modification across the test wall, with dissolution and re-precipitation at the inner-side, and overgrowth characterising the outer edge of the test. The general crystallographic orientation of the overgrowth observed in frosty M. crater indicates a retention of the original grain orientation (Figs.", "page": 16, "bbox": [46.8, 220.57, 548.6999999999999, 385.93], "is_caption": false, "caption_type": "", "scores": {"Input Fact": 0, "Hypothesis": 1, "Experiment": 0, "Technique": 2, "Result": 1, "Dataset": 0, "Analysis": 0, "Conclusion": 3}, "matches": {"CONC_SURFACE": 1, "TEC_USING": 1}}

Alternating high and low Mg/Ca bands are absent in the frosty M. crater specimen, with test chemistry now highly influenced by the chemistry of surrounding waters (Fig 5d,e). The loss of high Mg/Ca ratio bands during dissolution lowers the bulk Mg/Ca ratio of the test, a common observation in foraminiferal calcite that has undergone dissolution (Regenberg et al., 2014). The Mg/Ca composition of the calcite overgrowth observed in the frosty M. crater appears to be the same composition as the underlying re-precipitated material. This is an unexpected observation, as the inorganic overgrowth was unlikely to form at the exact same time as the re-precipitated material below, and raises the question as to whether calcite composition, potentially as a function of calcite microstructure, could be templated in overgrowth formation. The presence of magnesium in calcite is known to influence microstructure (Folk, 1974). High Mg in calcite facilitates vertical alignment of crystals, with \"Mgpoisoning\" (the addition of Mg 2+ ions to the side of a growing crystal, causing surrounding CO3 2-sheets to scrunch together to accommodate such Mg 2+ ions) inhibiting sideward growth (Folk, 1974).
