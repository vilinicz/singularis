    "text": "Widespread interest in non-destructive biomarkers of aging has led to a curse of plenty: a \nmultitude of biological ages that each proffers a \u2018true\u2019 health-adjusted age of an individual. \nWhile each measure provides salient information on the aging process, they are each univariate, \nin contrast to the \u201challmark\u201d and \u201cpillar\u201d theories of aging which are explicitly multidimensional, \nmulticausal and multiscale. Fortunately, multiple biological ages can be systematically combined \ninto a multidimensional network representation. The interaction network between these \nbiological ages permits analysis of the multidimensional effects of aging, as well as \nquantification of causal influences during both natural aging and, potentially, after anti-aging \nintervention. The behaviour of the system as a whole can then be explored using dynamical \nnetwork stability analysis which identifies new, efficient biomarkers that quantify long term \nresilience scores on the timescale between measurements (years). We demonstrate this approach \nusing a set of 8 biological ages from the longitudinal Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging \n(SATSA). After extracting an interaction network between these biological ages, we observed \nthat physiological age, a proxy for cardiometabolic health, serves as a central node in the \nnetwork, implicating it as a key vulnerability for slow, age-related decline. We furthermore show \nthat while the system as a whole is stable, there is a weakly stable direction along which recovery \nis slow \u2013\u2013 on the timescale of a human lifespan. This slow direction provides an aging biomarker \nwhich correlates strongly with chronological age and predicts longitudinal decline in health \u2014 \nsuggesting that it estimates an important driver of age-related changes.",

Each BA estimates an individual's health-adjusted effective \nage, which may differ from their chronological age (CA). Each BA uses a model that converts a \nbattery of measurements into a univariate proxy for health, either using regression on \nchronological age7 or a heuristic mapping into a specific measure of health such as risk of \ndeath5,6. Popular BAs have been extensively validated and are often sensitive to mortality risk9 \nand the effects of anti-aging interventions2.

Dynamical stability analysis tells us that systems \nwhich are mostly stable \u2014 such as living organisms \u2014 can be understood by the way in which \nthey respond to small perturbations. That is, we look for longitudinal disruptions to homeostasis \nand subsequent recovery (or lack there-of)23. The eigen-directions provide a spectrum of \nfundamental recovery rates (timescales), oriented to completely account for the complex \ninteractions of the network. These rates describe canonical changes so that we can infer long-\nterm behaviour by the slowest recovery rates23,24, which determine system resilience25. Taking a \nlong time to recover is indicative of weak stability and hence vulnerability to stochastic stressors, \nwhose effects tend to pile up along slow or unstable eigen-directions. Indeed, prior work on \nhealth biomarkers showed that across 4 datasets (2 mice, 2 humans), the dominant risk direction \nfor survival or dementia onset was always the first or second least-stable (slowest) eigen-\ndirection23.

In Figure S10 we compare 3 variants of our model to \nsimply carrying forward the previous value to predict the future value (equivalent to \ud835\udc7e= \ud835\udfce). \nThe fully flexible model is FullW, whereas the other models are simplified variants to reduce \noverfitting, specifically: assume that \ud835\udc7e is diagonal (DiagW) or assume that \ud835\udc7e is diagonal in PC-\nspace (SymW, where PCA forces \ud835\udc7e to be symmetric because PCA is an orthogonal \ntransformation). In both FullW and SymW we first performed a PCA transformation to avoid \ncollinearity issues and potential fit problems due to reduced-rank \ud835\udc7e (the transformation was \nlearned using timepoint 1). We use 632-corrected root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean \nabsolute error (MAE) to quantify error (lower is better); e.g.62 RMSE632 \u22610.632 \u22c5RMSEtest +\n0.368 \u22c5RMSEtrain (632-correction reduces bias23). We observe that all of our models out-\nperform forward carry (in which all values are carried forward unchanged to the next timepoint). \nAdditionally, FullW and SymW out-performed DiagW, indicating that an interaction network is \nsupported by the data.",

In Figure S11 we present the AUC33 for correctly predicting \nworsening. We observe that a causally unambiguous model (FullW) out-performs the \nsymmetrical \ud835\udc16 (SymW) at \ud835\udc5d= 0.1 (Delong test33). Hence, for both the MAE and the AUC we \nfind FullW out-performs SymW at 68% confidence (non-overlapping error bars). If the two \nmetrics (MAE and AUC) are independent we have \ud835\udc5d= 0.1 \u22c5(1 \u22120.68) = 0.04 which is \nsignificant at 95% confidence.

Fortunately, multiple biological ages can be systematically combined\ninto a multidimensional network representation. The interaction network between these\nbiological ages permits analysis of the multidimensional effects of aging, as well as\nquantification of causal influences during both natural aging and, potentially, after anti-aging\nintervention. The behaviour of the system as a whole can then be explored using dynamical\nnetwork stability analysis which identifies new, efficient biomarkers that quantify long term\nresilience scores on the timescale between measurements (years). We demonstrate this approach\nusing a set of 8 biological ages from the longitudinal Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging\n(SATSA). After extracting an interaction network between these biological ages, we observed\nthat physiological age, a proxy for cardiometabolic health, serves as a central node in the\nnetwork, implicating it as a key vulnerability for slow, age-related decline. We furthermore show\nthat while the system as a whole is stable, there is a weakly stable direction along which recovery\nis slow \u2013\u2013 on the timescale of a human lifespan. This slow direction provides an aging biomarker\nwhich correlates strongly with chronological age and predicts longitudinal decline in health \u2014\nsuggesting that it estimates an important driver of age-related changes.\nKeywords: complexity, eigen analysis, biological age, systems biology",

Each BA estimates an individual's health-adjusted effective\nage, which may differ from their chronological age (CA). Each BA uses a model that converts a\nbattery of measurements into a univariate proxy for health, either using regression on\nchronological age7 or a heuristic mapping into a specific measure of health such as risk of\ndeath5,6. Popular BAs have been extensively validated and are often sensitive to mortality risk9\nand the effects of anti-aging interventions2. While it is tempting to simply pick the best BA for a\nparticular application, or aggregate BAs using a heuristic approach10,11, this risks missing the\neffects of multivariate interactions during the aging process.",

Since salient aging information\nnaturally condenses into the least stable (slowest recovery) eigen-directions, these least stable\neigen-directions are the best way to describe the collective aging behaviour of a network of BAs.\nB\ny using longitudinal data, we can also potentially infer causality within our network. We have\nalready developed a generic model for homeostasis which estimates a network of interactions\nbetween biomarkers together with steady-state behaviour23. Although our model is trained using\nobservational data28, we expect that interventions that cause small perturbations will behave\nsimilarly to the random stresses which drive observational data \u2014 since these represent the\nrandom effects of interventions that individuals experience throughout their lives, such as\nlifestyle changes, medicine and disease. Previously, we found that including such directed\ncause \u2192 effect links conferred little benefit in reducing the root mean squared error (RMSE) of\nbiomarker trajectories. Here, we revisit this question with a novel quantitative score based on\npredicting the correct direction of biomarker change. As a result, we obtain a model that predicts\nboth the causal sequence of events occurring during normal aging and a best guess for how\ninterventions will propagate.\nW\ne demonstrate that network analysis can leverage the abundance of BAs to answer fundamental\nquestions about what causes aging and about how aging systems are likely to respond to\ninterventions. We apply our approach to longitudinal multivariate BA data, generating a network\ninteractome capable of capturing the coordinated effects of the BAs. By considering BAs from\nmultiple biological scales we can surmise how the effects of aging propagate from DNA to\nfunctional decline. Once the network is estimated, we can analyse its eigen-directions to\nunderstand how the aggregate effects of multiple BAs affect the organism as time progresses.\nThis yields dominant natural variables, which are the salient features of aging and provide\ncanonical coordinates. We show that the least stable natural variable is an efficient choice for\nmonitoring the aging process. We also show that the interaction network has vulnerabilities\nwhich are consistent with qualitative theories of aging, and is able to describe confounding\neffects of model interventions.\n3",

Each individual has a different number of total\nmeasurements before leaving the study, \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b, and hence Eq.

The\nmodel is only sensitive to changes which occur slower than the timescale set by \u0394\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5b+1, which for\nthis study is approximately 3 years. This means that short term changes such as due to a flu\ninfection appear in the noise term, \ud835\udeba. \ud835\udc7e captures only long term \u201cresilience\u201d, i.e. longitudinal\ncorrelations, over the course of years \u2014 such as age-related decline. The equilibrium position,\n\ud835\udf07\n \ud835\udc5b, is allowed to vary linearly with respect to a set of covariates for each individual, \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc5b, through\n\ud835\udeb2.\nThe diagonal elements of \ud835\udc7e permit recovery towards \ud835\udf07 \ud835\udc5b, whereas the off-diagonals couple\nvalues across BAs,\n\ud835\udc38(\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc5b+1 \u2212 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc5b)\n(2)\n,  \n= \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc38(\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc5b \u2212 \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc5b) + \u2211 \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc38(\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5b \u2212 \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5b)\n\ud835\udc38(\u0394\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5b+1)\n\ud835\udc58\u2260\ud835\udc57\nwhere \ud835\udc38(\ud835\udc65) represents the expectation value of \ud835\udc65.

This means that if \u2014\nthrough intervention or natural aging \u2014 the values of some of the BAs change, \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc58, then we will\nsee a change in each different \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc57 via \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc58.

We index the \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc58 by their\t\t\t\t\nsorted eigenvalue strength, such that \ud835\udc671 has the greatest (closest to +\u221e) eigenvalue \ud835\udf061. (For\t\t\t\t\nsimplicity, we drop the tilde notation for the remainder of the paper.) Observe that the natural\t\t\t\t\naging variables, \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc58, do not interact: they either increase, decrease or stay the same, depending on\t\t\t\t\nthe value of \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52(\ud835\udf06\ud835\udc58) as can be seen by iterating Eq.

The timescale over\t\t\t\t\nwhich these changes occur are set by |\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52(\ud835\udf06\ud835\udc58)|\u22121 \u2261 |\ud835\udf06\ud835\udc58|\u22121, i.e. the absolute value of the real part\t\t\t\t\nof \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc58 (\ud835\udf06\ud835\udc58 has units of years\u22121). The inverse timescale, \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc58, determines how quickly the average\t\t\t\t\nindividual reaches a steady-state. Since the \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc58 are independent via Eq. (3), events or\t\t\t\t\ninterventions which modulate only \ud835\udc38(\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc58) will not affect any other \ud835\udc38(\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc57). The payoff of this\t\t\t\t\napproach is two-fold: aging information gets compressed into a few specific variables, and the\t\t\t\t\ninterconnected system behaviour is greatly simplified.\t\t\t\t\nThe \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc58 are able to drive the observed BAs through the mapping \ud835\udc77\ud835\udc67  = \ud835\udc4f\u20d7 , which will spread out\t\t\t\t\nthe effects across several BAs since \ud835\udc77 is often dense23.

Because the \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc58 don't interact with each other, the intervention pinpoints one \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc58 that\nimmediately improves whereas the other \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc57 are unaffected. Depending on the stability of the\nintervened \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc58, the effect of the intervention is either gradually lost with age (stable), persists\nindefinitely (marginal stability/slow dimensions |\ud835\udf06\ud835\udc58| \u223c 1 lifespan\u22121), or improves with\nincreasing age (unstable). In the present study, interventions which improve \ud835\udc671 are most desirable\nsince they have the strongest relationship with health (Figure 3) and persist for a typical human\nlifespan. See the supplemental for other simulated interventions.\nD\niscussion\nThe ongoing proliferation of new BAs (biological ages) presents two opportunities for dynamical\nnetwork analysis: (1) BAs can be used to generate network interactomes to better understand\nhow age-related changes are naturally orchestrated and for comparison to theory, and (2) there is\nan increasing need for a robust method of aggregating multiple BAs. Here we address both\nopportunities. Using a dynamical model with minimal assumptions we are able to estimate an\ninteraction network from a collection of BAs. We can also apply eigen-analysis to the network\nsuch that we are able to generate dynamically-independent aggregate BAs \u2014 natural aging\nvariables. The slow recovery and age-related drift of these variables reflects their underlying\nimportance in quantifying the aging process. We propose that such natural variables are the\nnatural language to communicate the aging process, in the same manner that spectral signal\nanalysis has come to dominate many quantitative disciplines.\nThe estimated interaction network, \ud835\udc7e, encodes conditional dependencies across BAs of the\ncurrent timestate from the previous timestate.

However, the vast majority of health biomarkers change linearly with age40, and\nBAs are typically designed to track CA in units of time which, by definition, increases linearly\nwith age. The choice of units used to quantify aging may therefore play a role in determining\nwhat super-linear growth means, and therefore stability. A second issue is the effect of a\npopulation-level picture which can mask unstable sub-populations, such as those experiencing or\ntransitioning into chronic disease. This presents an opportunity for more powerful statistical\nmodels able to capture such individual effects. Note that a slow instability is indistinguishable\nfrom linear drift until advanced ages \u2014 where data are sparse. Our current perspective is that\norganisms live most of their lives in a stable regime of approximately linear decline until a\ntipping point is reached and non-linear collapse ensues, quickly leading to organism death or\nchronic disease.\nWhile linear drift is reasonable population-level behaviour for the BAs and \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc58, a tipping point\nleading to super-linear behaviour is necessary to make sense of terminal decline. Terminal\ndecline occurs in biomarkers of death wherein immediately prior to death they become much\nworse, driving up the hazard and dropping the survival probability towards 0 over a short period\nof time. This effect can be seen empirically, for example, in the FI41, cognition42 and gait42 which\nshow a dramatic change in slope occurring around 3-4 years prior to death. Two dynamical\nphases are needed to capture this effect, such as those elucidated by the saturating-repair model\nof aging43,44. In this model, age-related decline begins as a stable, approximately linear system\nuntil repair processes \u201csaturate\u201d and a new super-linear phase begins. This model unifies ideas of\ncritical behaviour26,45,46 with damage and repair47,48, which have been increasingly used within\nthe aging modelling literature. Our prior results from mice and humans supports the important\npredictions made by the saturating-repair model, including \u201cmallostasis\u201d23: the correlation\nbetween mortality hazard and linear drift rate43. The linear phase is characterised by a linear\nincrease in the homeostatic steady-state and is ostensibly driven by asymmetric transitions such\nas epigenetic methylation and accumulation of disease49. We hypothesize that the linear phase\nserves to push individuals towards tolerance thresholds (tipping points) upon which a super-\nlinear phase ensues, quickly leading to death or disease e.g. due to the saturation of repair\nprocesses.\nIt is important to understand that our model is of slow, linear dynamics in \ud835\udc7e at timescales slower\nthan the interval between measurements (years). Faster dynamics are pushed into the noise term,\n\ud835\udeba. The effects of the fast dynamics are to cause biomarkers to rapidly change in values from day\nto day, whereas the slow dynamics estimated by \ud835\udc7e are long term changes over the course of\nhuman-equivalent years. The resilience score we estimate using \ud835\udc7e represents resilience on the\ntimescale of years, which (we believe) is a good timescale to assess aging.  Nevertheless, this is",

In contrast, we observed no clear age-dependence\nfor the slow-resilience assessed by our \ud835\udc7e-analysis, noting the large error bars (supplemental). A\nclear age-dependent drop in the eigenvalues of \ud835\udc7e could be an indication of saturating repair, but\nthe effect is indirect and bounded at 0,43,44 which may make it difficult to observe. The correct\ninterpretation of \ud835\udc7e-resilience is currently unclear. \ud835\udc7e is capturing the long-term decline due to\naging through the longitudinal correlations it causes in the biological ages. The smallest\neigenvalues have the longest memories and hence they are the natural place for information\nregarding long term and irreversible changes to build up, making the associated eigenvectors\nexcellent predictors of age-related health.\nOur relatively modest predictive performance of worsening (AUC 0.764 \u00b1 0.005 ), and\nexplained FI variance of approximately 30%, suggests that we have only captured some of the\nage-related changes. Our model achieved a prediction error on the order of approximately\n6 years for BA progression after an average of 3 years of natural aging, representing 65% of the\nvariance. Model error encapsulates the net effect of four major sources: missing values,\nunobserved variables, stochasticity, and model misspecification. The missingness was\nparticularly high in the present study, especially for the epigenetic BAs, which were more likely\nto be missing for older individuals (thus non-random), which could lead to bias \u2014 even with\ngood imputation35. This missingness reduces data quality and quantity, which may explain why\nwe did not achieve statistical significance when comparing only the AUC of FullW vs SymW\n(\ud835\udc5d = 0.1). Second, we relied on only 8 BAs to completely predict future health including only\nsex as a covariate. This limits predictive power and our ability to detect causal relationships,\nsince we cannot identify causal connections from unobserved variables50. While it is impossible\nto capture all information, we would hope to find a saturation \u2018elbow\u2019 at some larger number of\nBAs. Third, in addition to intrinsic stochasticity, there is substantial stochasticity owing to non-\nlab conditions (individual variability) and measurement noise, putting severe limits of\npredictability. Finally, our model is a local approximation near stable homeostasis and does not\ncapture sudden changes, such as may occur due to the emergence of an underlying chronic\ncondition.

The FI is skewed due to being bound at 0, the\ntransformation removes that skewness and instead we have a normally-distributed error term (red\nline).\nObserve that if we can estimate \ud835\udefe/\ud835\udefc then we can estimate the remaining terms in Eq. (S6) using\nlinear regression. We iteratively fit a linear model using linear regression and picked the\nparameter \ud835\udefe/\ud835\udefc that minimized the absolute residual skewness. This yielded the estimate \ud835\udefe/\ud835\udefc =\n0.065.\nMinimizing the skewness is a technical assumption to get a transformed \ud835\udc53 which is symmetrical,\nthis is needed because the loss functions we use are symmetrical. If the transformed \ud835\udc53 was\nasymmetrical then the fitted models would ignore extreme values, instead fitting to the bulk of\nthe distribution. This effect is seen with the untransformed \ud835\udc53, for which the linearized models we\nuse ignore individuals near \ud835\udc53 = 0 which leads the models to greatly over-estimate \ud835\udc53 for healthy\nindividuals (not shown).\nIn summary, the FI, \ud835\udc53, is linearized by the invertible transformation ln(\ud835\udc53 + 0.065), allowing us\nto use linear models in our analysis.  Our FI model in the simulations uses the transformation\npurely as a technical pre-processing step to improve the regression fit. Our network model in\nSensitivity Analysis however treats the transformed FI as another BA to include in the model.\nReaders should be aware that this network model predicts the transformed FI, not the true FI.\nThe transformed FI is an unscaled biological age with slope equal to the damage propagation rate",

Horvath and Hannum both\ncapture age-associated epigenetic changes via penalized regression, irrespective of their\nrelationship to health9. GrimAge and PhenoAge are more refined since they capture effective\nsurvival risk age. GrimAge uses an intermediate step such that only epigenetic changes\nassociated with smoker pack-years or specific proteins are used, the latter are associated with a\nvariety of conditions including inflammation, cardiometabolic dysfunction and cellular\nfunctioning6. PhenoAge, in contrast, uses epigenetic changes to predict individualized mortality\nrisk using a Gompertz model of survival with proportional hazards5. PhysioAge estimates a\nlatent (unobservable) variable which captures mutual age-dependence between the variables and\nchronological age, each biomarker and chronological age are modelled as a linear function of the\nlatent variable7. The variables used are overwhelmingly cardiometabolic, hence PhysioAge likely\nrepresents age-related changes to the cardiometabolic system. Cognition is a general cognitive\nability score: the first principal component from a battery of cognitive tests53. FAI is based on\nself-reported sensory ability (hearing and seeing), and measured: lung strength, grip strength and\ngait speed54.

In Figure S10 we compare 3 variants of our model to\nsimply carrying forward the previous value to predict the future value (equivalent to \ud835\udc7e = \ud835\udfce).\nThe fully flexible model is FullW, whereas the other models are simplified variants to reduce\noverfitting, specifically: assume that \ud835\udc7e is diagonal (DiagW) or assume that \ud835\udc7e is diagonal in PC-\nspace (SymW, where PCA forces \ud835\udc7e to be symmetric because PCA is an orthogonal\ntransformation). In both FullW and SymW we first performed a PCA transformation to avoid\ncollinearity issues and potential fit problems due to reduced-rank \ud835\udc7e (the transformation was\nlearned using timepoint 1). We use 632-corrected root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean\nabsolute error (MAE) to quantify error (lower is better); e.g.62 RMSE632 \u2261 0.632 \u22c5 RMSEtest +\n0.368 \u22c5 RMSEtrain (632-correction reduces bias23). We observe that all of our models out-\nperform forward carry (in which all values are carried forward unchanged to the next timepoint).\nAdditionally, FullW and SymW out-performed DiagW, indicating that an interaction network is\nsupported by the data.",

In the main analysis we\nwithheld the FI as a proxy for longitudinal changes in health. The FI can be alternatively treated\nas yet another BA, with the caveat that it should be transformed to prevent issues with fitting (the\nmodel assumes normal errors, so it won\u2019t fit to FI=0 since it is always assuming symmetric\nerrors above and below the mean).

(S5)\nwith \ud835\udefe/\ud835\udefc = 0.065 and then scaled to match the mean and standard deviations of CA,\nspecifically we multiplied by 22.11 then added 111.2. After transformation, the FI can be treated\nas normal along with the other BAs. For fitting, we pre-processed the input (BAs and CA) using\nPCA, picking the optimal number to minimize the 632-RMSE, which was 9 PCs (max: 10). The\nestimated network is presented in Figure S22. Where we have additionally included CA (age).\nThe main features of the network are unchanged: PhysioAge still plays a central role with a\nsecondary role for GrimAge (i.e. many outgoing links). Age (CA) appears to also have a central\nrole, ostensibly representing unaccounted aging-related degrees-of-freedom. Note that the FI\nappears to be weakly connected to the others, primarily interacting with FAI. The FAI captures\nvery similar phenomenon to the FI, in particular the FAI is composed of measures which were\neither directly included in the FI (self-reported hearing and vision) or which modify FI variables\n(e.g. ADLs)54,55.\nW\ne can use the network to see how information propagates into the FI, a proxy for organism-\nlevel health. For example FAI, PhysioAge and Age can directly influence the FI and also gate all\nincoming information into the FI, whereas e.g. GrimAge must first modify one of those three to\naffect the FI. The implication is that genetic and epigenetic changes do not directly affect the FI.\nThis is consistent with a recent longitudinal bivariate association study of the FI which found no\nassociation with Hannum, Horvath, PhenoAge or GrimAge, although they did find a directed\nassociation from DunedinPACE to the FI37 (DunedinPACE is not included in the present study\ndataset).\n59",

Age and the FI can be included in the\nnetwork, allowing us to see how information moves in and out. Observe that the essential\nfeatures of the network are similar to the main text (Figure 1): with central nodes of\nPhysioAge and GrimAge. Age is another central node, ostensibly representing unaccounted\naging effects that are not captured by the BAs. The FI appears to only connect with higher-\nlevel scales: PhysioAge, FAI and Age, having only indirect connections to epigenetic and\ngenetic scales. The FI has been log-scale as described in the text. Both representations a) and\nb) are equivalent.",
