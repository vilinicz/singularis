    "text": "feedback, offer a promising solution [3]. By detecting motor\nintention, BCIs provide an objective measure of MI quality\nand enable feedback only when correct motor imagery is\nidentified. This strategy aligns with a fundamental principle\nof neurofeedback: rewards should only be given when pa-\ntients perform tasks that deserve a reward [4]. Several studies\nhave shown that MI can activate the same neural networks\ninvolved in movement execution [5]. This evidence supports\nits relevance for rehabilitation, and when integrated into a\nBCI system, enables closed-loop operation [6]. Motor im-\nagery triggers event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS)\nof sensorimotor rhythms (SMR). When combined with visual\nor proprioceptive neurofeedback, it may enable patients to\nlearn how to voluntarily modulate SMR activity, making it a\npromising tool for motor rehabilitation. This volitional modu-\nlation induces sensorimotor cortical activation and promotes\nneuroplasticity by engaging new brain circuits, potentially\naccelerating functional recovery.\nThere is evidence that BCI-based rehabilitation can be\nmore effective than traditional rehabilitation. However, its\neffectiveness largely depends on the system\u2019s reliability\nto detect motor imagery, which consequently depends on\nthe subject\u2019s ability to perform motor imagery. Usually,\nMI-BCI systems operate by detecting a decrease in the\n\u00b5 (8\u201312 Hz) and \u03b2 (13\u201330 Hz) band powers over the\nsensorimotor area. Left vs. right-hand MI paradigms for\nupper-limb rehabilitation rely on contralateral brain activa-\ntion [6]. However, this pattern of contralateral-lateralized\nactivation is often disrupted in stroke patients. Studies have\nshown that during passive movement of the unaffected hand,\nbrain activation typically follows the expected contralateral-\nlateralized pattern. In contrast, passive movement of the\naffected hand tends to elicit compensatory activation in\nthe ipsilateral (i.e., contralesional) hemisphere [7], [8]. This\ncompensatory activation is more pronounced in patients with\ngreater motor impairments, reflecting a loss of lateralization\n[9]. Such altered activation patterns can negatively affect the\nperformance of left vs. right-hand MI paradigms.\nIn this study, we investigate an alternative rehabilitation\nparadigm, utilizing affected-hand movement versus rest. This\napproach has the advantage of simplicity, as it requires the\npatient to perform only one type of motor imagery. Since MI\ntraining can gradually restore typical contralateralization by\nreducing compensatory ipsilateral activation [8], we can use\npersonalized rehabilitation by dynamically adapting MI-BCI\nsystems as patients progress, beginning with a movement\nvs. rest paradigm and changing to the more standard left vs.\nright-hand MI. Additionally, we explore the impact of short",

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have\nemerged as a promising tool for post-stroke rehabilitation by\npromoting neuroplasticity. However, clinical outcomes remain\nvariable, and optimal protocols have yet to be established. This\nstudy explores strategies to optimize BCI-based rehabilitation\nby comparing motor imagery of affected hand movement versus\nrest, instead of the conventional left-versus-right motor imagery.\nThis alternative aims to simplify the task and address the weak\ncontralateral activation commonly observed in stroke patients.\nTwo datasets, one from healthy individuals and one from stroke\npatients, were used to evaluate the proposed approach. The\nresults showed improved performance using both FBCSP and\nEEGNet.

    "text": "According to the World Health Organization from 1990 to\n2019, the number of strokes increased dramatically by about\n70%, with more than 12.2 million new strokes each year.\nThe estimated global cost of stroke is over US721 billion\n[1]. Post-stroke survivors suffer a significant loss of neuronal\nfunctions, mainly in the sensorimotor area. Therefore, in\nsome cases, they have severe motor impairments and tend to\nlose a significant degree of autonomy in daily tasks, making\nthem very dependent on others. Motor impairment in elderly\nindividuals is up to 80% and only about 20% experience\npartial recovery [2]. Despite advances in acute stroke treat-\nment, functional recovery remains limited, highlighting the\nneed for novel rehabilitation strategies. Motor imagery (MI)\ntherapy is one of the conventional approaches used in upper\nlimb rehabilitation. In motor imagery therapy, patients are\ninstructed to mentally simulate movement of the affected\nlimb without actual execution. However, there is no objective\nway to confirm whether MI is performed correctly.
