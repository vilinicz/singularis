    "text": "tropy management. We find entropy is an inclusive\nrather\nthan\nexclusive aging theory.\nIntroduction\nThe biology of aging can be described by the phrase, “things\nfall apart”. Researchers\nhave noted that though there is rhyme and similarity to aging among individuals, each\ncase is unique and unprogrammed [1, 2, 3]. Leonard Hayflick [4] has argued for decades\nthat aging is entropy, an increase in molecular disorder over time. The concept thus far\nhas only enjoyed modest popularity, perhaps because it does immediately offer a direct\nmeans of measurement, treatment, or a specific molecular mechanism.\nReferences\nto entropy in aging research are often vague and allusory,\nlacking spe-\ncific measurement and offering few testable hypotheses.\nIn principle, the things that re-\nsearchers have been measuring all along, and which are known to modify lifespan, should\nalso fit naturally within the variables that describe entropy; this has yet to be emphati-\ncally shown. The purpose of this manuscript is to make a bridge between the world that\nthe biology of aging knows and measures, and the physical understanding of entropy.\nSuperficially, the signature of entropy whittling at organism genomes across time may\nbe recognized as the accumulation of deleterious mutations. As deleterious mutations ac-\ncumulate,\ninformation disperses. Mutation accumulation is notably a familiar concept to\naging biology, being among the oldest concepts in the field in one form or another.[5, 6, 7].\nThe idea of accumulating errors\nleading to critical breakdowns of biological\nsystems\nis\nreferred to as a “error catastrophe” or “mutation catastrophe”. A modern version of mu-\ntation catastrophe is\nsupported by some evidence; DNA mutations do accumulate over",

However, we note that mutation accumulation need\nnot only refer to DNA,\nif the definition is broadened: what is epigenetic information loss,\nif\nit is not the accumulation of (epi)mutations? While acknowledging the importance of\nDNA mutations in the aging process [11], for example in the emergence of cancer [12], the\nfield has been emphasizing for years that epimutations likely also have a proximal role to\nplay in both aging and cancer. Compounding evidence [13] and recent experimentation\n[14] have highlighted the need for a model that includes, or even emphasizes the impor-\ntance of epigenetic information in aging.\nIdeally, a theory should be flexible to account\nfor aging of all sorts, even for organisms that age over the course of days, such as in E.\ncoli.\nWe propose a model where the accumulation of mutations over time between at least\ntwo points can be considered a “mutational distance”. We fit the concept of mutational\ndistance to physics definitions of distance via an advection-diffusion equation for the Brow-\nnian motion of tracers in a fluid flow, and use the result to model the change in entropy\nover time. From a starting point of highly similar cells within a population, the cells ac-\ncumulate mutational distance over time. The model fits to DNA mutation accumulation\nexperiments. We then model epimutation as a primary factor\nin the determination of\nlongevity, though the role of DNA mutation and any other system of entropic gain may\nbe added to the model as appropriate. We fit the model to organisms of varying lifespan\nand demonstrate the model’s flexibility, which predicts that an entropic failure threshold\ncauses biological mortality, via age-related phenotypes. We also examine a simple bino-\nmial entropy conversion for diverse biological systems, and its application to age-related\nmolecular change. These simplified models suggest that aging may be entropy; and that\nentropy also increases within germline lineages as well,\nin the relative absence of selection.",

When interpreting\nmutational distance as physical distance,\nthis perspective allows\nthe import of physics\nequations that model evolution over time, with particular consideration of Brownian mo-\ntion, and random walks of molecules.\nThe model considers mutation accumulation as\na one-dimensional distance and how a population of molecules will be distributed as a\nfunction of time, following a normal distribution.

This perspective began as a study of the phenotypic\nsimilarities emergent in mutation accumulation experiments and of the biology of aging,\nor specifically, an inescapable degradation of biological phenotypes in these contexts.\nBy recognizing that mutational distance is equivalent to physical distance, equations\nof physics may be applied to biological data. The advection-diffusion equation models\nthe dispersion of molecules\nfrom a starting state of\nidentical position,\nto a probability\ndistribution of distance over\ntime.\nThis dispersion can be\nreadily appreciated in the\nacquisition of DNA mutations over the course of human development and aging: all cells\nstart out with an identical genotype, but over time a clock-like distance from the starting\nstate to an aged state emerges over time. The model predicts an increased dispersion of\nmutational distance in chromatin or in DNA, though we also focus upon chromatin and\nits information storage role.\nImportantly, we find that\nthe advection-diffusion equation\ncan be modeled to fit mutation accumulation data from E.\ncoli\nreasonably well,\nand\ncan resolve the expected deviation in mutation rate between wild-type and hypermutator\nstrains. The key insight of the advection-diffusion equation is its provision of a description\nof the variance of the Gaussian distribution in an age-related context.\nMathematicians and physicists have long recognized the importance of the Gaussian\ndistribution to the study of entropy. The equation for entropy in a Gaussian system is\nstraightforward (Equation (3)); the parameter of importance is the variable D in Equation\n(2). The model compares which values of D might give rise to known lifespan estimates\nacross\nthe\ntree of\nlife.\nThe model\nindicates\nthat\nthe organisms are hitting a similar\nentropy threshold for varying levels of D.\nBy combining the perspectives of Figure 1",

    "text": "The Shannon entropy of a binomially distributed random variable is\n1 2\n(ln |np(1 − p)2π| + 1).\n(15)\nHbinom =\nwhile for a Gaussian distributed random variable it is\n1 2\n(ln |σ22π| + 1).\n(16)\nHGauss =\nOne can see the similarity in the Shannon entropy for each model. For the Gaussian shapes\nintroduced by the ‘diffusion’ of epigenetic mutations via the solution to the advection-\ndiffusion equation (Eq.\n(2)) where σ2 = 2Dt, we arrive at an expression for the epigenetic\nentropy as defined in Equation(3). This assumes\nthat D is constant\nin time and x, al-\nthough there are many factors which could affect the value of D. An interesting feature of\nthis formulation is that drift or advection Dλ only factors into the entropy gain through\nthe diffusion constant with the factor λ omitted. To understand this we revisit\nthe in-\nterpretation of λ. Our interpretation is that this represents a ratio of relative efficiency\nof drift versus diffusion and as\nsuch does not\nreflect on the nature of\nthe system with\ninformation about either drift or diffusion. Furthermore, since entropy is the measure of\nthe disorder of a system, λ contains no information about the distribution of states within\nthe system. We can reconcile this by considering the simple case where D = 0, which cor-\nresponds to the situation where all change occurs exactly on one methyl group (although\nnot necessarily the same one) every unit of\ntime in the same direction. As\nfar as\nthis\nmodel\nis concerned, the system of\nindependently mutating cells retains its configuration\nfor all times and thus has a constant entropy in time.\nWe plot the Shannon entropy for a few values of D in Figure 2 and compare with the\napproximate maximum lifespan of a few example organisms. We find that an entropy\nthreshold of approximately 8 coincides with a number of these organisms. One possible\ninterpretation is that, regardless of species, fitness breaks down at some entropy threshold\n19",
